## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (v6 or later)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/livecode.git
   cd livecode
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm run install-all
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
   ```
   
   If you don't have a Groq API key, you can still run the application in mock mode.

### Running the Application

To start both the server and client with a single command:

```bash
npm run launch
```

This will start:
- Backend server on http://localhost:5000
- Frontend client on http://localhost:3000

You can also run them separately:

```bash
# Start just the server
npm run server

# Start just the client
npm run client
```
